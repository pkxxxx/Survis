abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have increasingly become vital in our eve- ryday lives. Education is one of the most visible domains in which these technolo- gies are being used. Conversational Agents (CAs) are among the most prominent AI systems for assisting teaching and learning processes. Their integration into an e-learning system can provide replies suited to each learnerâ€™s specific needs, allow- ing them to study at their own pace. In this paper, based on recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, we present an experimental implementation of an educational chatbot intended to instruct second- ary school learners Logo, an educational programming language. The related chat- bot was implemented and evaluated in Moroccan public schools with the support of teachers from the Regional Center for Education and Training Professions of Souss Massa. The experiments included 109 students grouped into three separate classes. One is a control class group that uses a traditional approach, while the other two are experimental groups that employ digital content and the chatbot-based method. Preliminary findings indicate that employing chatbots can greatly enhance student learning experiences by allowing them to study at their own speed with less stress, saving them time, and keeping them motivated. Furthermore, integrating these AI systems into a smart classroom will not only create a supportive environment by encouraging good interactions with students, it will also allow learners to be more engaged and achieve better academic objectives.},
