abstract = {Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have paved the way for the increasing adoption of chatbots in language learning. Research published to date has mostly focused on chatbot accuracy and chatbot–human communication from students’ or in-service teachers’ perspectives. This study aims to examine the knowledge, level of satisfaction and perceptions concerning the integration of conversational AI in language learning among future educators. In this mixed method research based on convenience sampling, 176 undergraduates from two educational settings, Spain (n = 115) and Poland (n = 61), interacted autonomously with three conversational agents (Replika, Kuki, Wysa) over a four-week period. A learning module about Artificial Intelligence and language learning was specifically designed for this research, including an ad hoc model named the Chatbot–Human Interaction Satisfaction Model (CHISM), which was used by teacher candidates to evaluate different linguistic and technological features of the three conversational agents. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a pre-post-survey based on the CHISM and the TAM2 (technology acceptance) models and a template analysis (TA), and analyzed through IBM SPSS 22 and QDA Miner software. The analysis yielded positive results regarding perceptions concerning the integration of conversational agents in language learning, particularly in relation to perceived ease of use (PeU) and attitudes (AT), but the scores for behavioral intention (BI) were more moderate. The findings also unveiled some gender-related differences regarding participants’ satisfaction with chatbot design and topics of interaction.},
