        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have increasingly become vital in our eve- ryday lives. Education is one of the most visible domains in which these technolo- gies are being used. Conversational Agents (CAs) are among the most prominent AI systems for assisting teaching and learning processes. Their integration into an e-learning system can provide replies suited to each learner\u2019s specific needs, allow- ing them to study at their own pace. In this paper, based on recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, we present an experimental implementation of an educational chatbot intended to instruct second- ary school learners Logo, an educational programming language. The related chat- bot was implemented and evaluated in Moroccan public schools with the support of teachers from the Regional Center for Education and Training Professions of Souss Massa. The experiments included 109 students grouped into three separate classes. One is a control class group that uses a traditional approach, while the other two are experimental groups that employ digital content and the chatbot-based method. Preliminary findings indicate that employing chatbots can greatly enhance student learning experiences by allowing them to study at their own speed with less stress, saving them time, and keeping them motivated. Furthermore, integrating these AI systems into a smart classroom will not only create a supportive environment by encouraging good interactions with students, it will also allow learners to be more engaged and achieve better academic objectives.",

        "abstract": "In higher education, low teacher-student ratios can make it difficult for students to receive immediate and interactive help. Chatbots, increasingly used in various scenarios such as customer service, work productivity, and healthcare, might be one way of helping instructors better meet student needs. However, few empirical studies in the field of Information Systems (IS) have investigated pedagogical chatbot efficacy in higher education and fewer still discuss their potential challenges and drawbacks. In this research we address this gap in the IS literature by exploring the opportunities, challenges, efficacy, and ethical concerns of using chatbots as pedagogical tools in business education. In this two study project, we conducted a chatbot-guided interview with 215 undergraduate students to understand student attitudes regarding the potential benefits and challenges of using chatbots as intelligent student assistants. Our findings revealed the potential for chatbots to help students learn basic content in a responsive, interactive, and confidential way. Findings also provided insights into student learning needs which we then used to design and develop a new, experimental chatbot assistant to teach basic AI concepts to 195 students. Results of this second study suggest chatbots can be engaging and responsive conversational learning tools for teaching basic concepts and for providing educational resources. Herein, we provide the results of both studies and discuss possible promising opportunities and ethical implications of using chatbots to support inclusive learning.",

Many studies examined the effect of chatbots on learning outcomes. However, scant studies summarized the effectiveness of chatbots in education. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of chatbot-assisted learning on various components and how different moderator variables influenced the effectiveness. This study, through a meta-analysis, reviewed 32 empirical studies with 2201 participants published between 2010 and 2022. The results showed that chatbot technology exerted a medium-to-high effect on overall learning outcomes regardless of moderator variables, i.e., intervention duration, chatbot roles, and learning content. In terms of learning components, chatbots could significantly improve explicit reasoning, learning achievement, knowledge retention, and learning interest despite negative findings in critical thinking, learning engagement, and motivation. Future research could expand chatbot research by including different learning components.",

        "abstract": "Conversation practice, while paramount for all language learners, can be difficult to get enough of and very expensive. In this mobile age, chatbots are an obvious means of filling this gap, but have yet to realize their potential as practice partners. The current study was undertaken to examine why chatbots are not yet a substantial instrument for language learning engagement/practice, and to provide direction for future practice and chatbot development. To this end, building on a recent experimental study examining chatbot novelty effects, students undertook a pair of conversation activities: human and human-chatbot (via speech-to-text software). Immediately following the practice conversations, students' interest in the two partners was surveyed and open-ended textual feedback was collected. With these data sources and prior standardised test results, regression and content analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings indicated: 1) prior interest in human conversation partners was the best single predictor of future interest in chatbot conversations, 2) prior language competency was more strongly linked to interest in chatbot than human conversations, 3) that the qualitative experience of having \u201clearned more\u201d with the chatbot was strongly connected to task interest, even when reporting communication difficulties. Implications for practicing languages with currently available chatbots, for chatbots and related educational technology as sources of student interest and directions for chatbots future development are discussed. \u2022Students' experiences with chatbots as language learning partners was assessed.\u2022Interest in Human conversation was the strongest predictor of interest in chatbots.\u2022Seeing chatbots as an opportunity to \u201clearn-more\u201d was strongly linked to interest.",

        "abstract": "Background The use of chatbots as learning assistants is receiving increasing attention in language learning due to their ability to converse with students using natural language. Previous reviews mainly focused on only one or two narrow aspects of chatbot use in language learning. This review goes beyond merely reporting the specific types of chatbot employed in past empirical studies and examines the usefulness of chatbots in language learning, including first language learning, second language learning, and foreign language learning. Aims The primary purpose of this review is to discover the possible technological, pedagogical, and social affordances enabled by chatbots in language learning. Materials & Methods We conducted a systematic search and identifies 25 empirical studies that examined the use of chatbots in language learning. We used the inductive grounded approach to identify the technological and pedagogical affordances, and the challenges of using chatbots for students\u2019 language learning. We used Garrison's social presence framework to analyze the social affordances of using chatbots in language learning Results Our findings revealed three technological affordances: timeliness, ease of use, and personalization, and five pedagogical uses: as interlocutors, as simulations, for transmission, as helplines, and for recommendations. Chatbots appeared to encourage students\u2019 social presence by affective, open, and coherent communication. Several challenges in using chatbots were identified: technological limitations, the novelty effect, and cognitive load. Discussion and Conclusion A set of rudimentary design principles for chatbots are proposed for meaningfully implementing educational chatbots in language learning, and detailed suggestions for future research are presented. Lay Description What is already known about this topic Chatbots can communicate with users in the target languages. Chatbot\u2010supported activities enable an authentic language environment. The use of chatbots is limited by their capabilities. What this paper adds This review is the first to examine the usefulness of chatbot in language learning. Using chatbots had positive results on students' behavioural outcomes. Social presence can be established through the use of chatbots. Three main challenges of using chatbots are found. Implications for practice and/or policy Chatbots can perform the function of learning partners outside the classroom. Educators can use chatbots to personalize assessment and feedback practices. Researchers are advised to include objective measurements in future studies. Teachers' perceptions of using chatbots could be explored in the future.",

        "abstract": "Educational chatbots (ECs) are chatbots designed for pedagogical purposes and are viewed as an Internet of Things (IoT) interface that could revolutionize teaching and learning. These chatbots are strategized to provide personalized learning through the concept of a virtual assistant that replicates humanized conversation. Nevertheless, in the education paradigm, ECs are still novel with challenges in facilitating, deploying, designing, and integrating it as an effective pedagogical tool across multiple fields, and one such area is project-based learning. Therefore, the present study investigates how integrating ECs to facilitate team-based projects for a design course could influence learning outcomes. Based on a mixed-method quasi-experimental approach, ECs were found to improve learning performance and teamwork with a practical impact. Moreover, it was found that ECs facilitated collaboration among team members that indirectly influenced their ability to perform as a team. Nevertheless, affective-motivational learning outcomes such as perception of learning, need for cognition, motivation, and creative self-efficacy were not influenced by ECs. Henceforth, this study aims to add to the current body of knowledge on the design and development of EC by introducing a new collective design strategy and its pedagogical and practical implications.",

        "abstract": "Educational chatbots have been shown to be useful assistants in computer-supported learning settings. However, how does feedback of an educational chatbot impact on the learner\u2019s attention? Thus, this paper proposes a study to measure changes in human attention when learning by using an educational chatbot Liza that is intended to improve human reasoning ability. In total, 18 participants participated in the study and had a conversation with Liza. During the interaction with Liza, the attention of the study participants was measured using a mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) device. Three findings have been determined based on statistics methods. First, it was found that there was a significant attention effect occurring in 54% of the times, after the educational chatbot showed feedback and the attention measurement took place over the length of a task. Second, when differentiating the type of feedback, positive feedback had a significant effect in 71 of these 137 cases (51.82%) and negative feedback had a significant effect in 66 of the 137 cases (48.18%). Third, statistical results showed that there was no significant difference in attention at the significant level of 0.05 during the 10 seconds before, and 10 seconds after positive feedback is received. Similar is the case for negative feedback.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta\u2010analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta\u2010analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta\u2010analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human\u2010like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been gaining increasing popularity in education. Studies undertaken so far have provided conflicting evidence concerning the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. There has remained a paucity of meta\u2010analyses synthesizing the contradictory findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. What this paper adds This study, through meta\u2010analysis, synthesized these recent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. This study found that AI chatbots could have a large effect on students' learning outcomes. This study found that the effects of AI chatbots were moderated by educational levels and intervention duration. Implications for practice and/or policy AI chatbot designers could make AI chatbots better by equipping AI chatbots with human\u2010like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence Practitioners and/or teachers should draw attention to the positive and negative effects of AI chatbots on students. Considering the importance of ChatGPT, more research is required to develop a better understanding of the effects of ChatGPT in education. More research is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes.",
